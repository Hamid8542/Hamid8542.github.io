<a href = " https://www.hamidibrahim.net/ "> About Me </a>

  <p> My name is Abdulhamid Ibrahim, immigrant from Ethiopia, married man, no kid yet. I had a bachelorâ€™s 
      degree in electrical and Electronics Engineering; specialized in Instrumentation Technology, I worked 
      to one of the government organization for a couple of years. But I go back to school to study Computer 
      science, since computer and developing software was my dream carrier and that is what I want to do in 
      my entire life, so I got my Postgraduate diploma in computer science, the funny thing was I could not
      get a job as a software developer, since it was very difficult to get one. So, I got haired as network 
      administrator and got the opportunity to work with various vendors. I managed to automate the company,
      installing network cables, Cisco switch and routers, installing software and mange the day-to-day activity
      and helping employees with their connectivity as well as application issues.  
    </p> 
  <p>In October 2010, I went to Canada and start living there, as I expected life was not easy, and zero 
      chance to go to school since no body take care of my bill. I work hard for four years and decide to come 
      to United States. I always thinking in my head that I want to go to descent school and got all the cutting-edge 
      technologies and be competitive in the market, but still, I could not make it. I start to work as a desktop
      administrator, Network Technician, and so forth, but it does not worth it at all.  
   </p>
    <p> After 10 years I went back home, Ethiopia, to visit my country, family as well as my friends, I spent 
        very cool time. While I was preparing to return to the united states, unfortunately, the horrific 
        COVID-19 was become one of the dominate issue to the entire world, all flight was cancelled and no 
        flight at all. Most countries locked dawn. So, there was no way back to the united states since all 
        flight were cancelled. To make the story short, I stayed for 10 months, and come back on September 2020. 
        When I arrived sweet home, Dallas, United States; country wide the economy become slow dawn and I could 
        not get job. so, I decide that here the right time to go back to school, my ever dream carrier, the one
        I want to do it in my life, here we go, here I am at Maharishi International University. I hope my 
        decision was right and I have strong filling that Maharishi International University will fulfill my 
        dream. 

    <p> Thank You </p>
