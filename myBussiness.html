    <h2> We are Helping Thousands of Hard Working People To Switch It Up And Become Online Entrepreneurs</h2>
    <h3></h3>

    <p> Over the last couple of years, I have coached, advised and cheered on dozens of men and women who were 
        focused and ready to take on the challenge of creating their own online business. Some of these men 
        and women were stay at home mothers who wanted to start a business to supplement their household 
        income and help ease the burden on their significant other. Some of these women were employed in 
        jobs that didn’t satisfy them but knew if they could work 9-5 for someone else, they could put those
        same skills to work for their own business. Some of these women were fresh out of school or unemployed 
        and wanted to create their own opportunity instead of waiting to be selected from a list of candidates 
        for a job! These women went on to start businesses hand making crafts, becoming coaches, virtual 
        assistants, championing non-profits, and writing blogs and books of their own!  if you want to learn

        <p> Each and every woman I have worked with has had a unique story and has taken a unique path to creating 
        their own dream job, but they all had one thing in common. They knew that they were ready to act. They 
        knew it was time to take control of their own destinies, and they knew that they couldn’t sit by and 
        let things be for another day, another month or another year. The truth is, there is no right time to 
        start a business. The process will shake up your life in ways you could never expect, so if you know 
        it’s what you want to do, you can’t spend anymore time waiting. Time only makes it harder to succeed! </p>
