        "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, 
        muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is 
        the way to success." --Swami Vivekananda

    <div class="box2"><h1>Avoid Negative Energy</h1>
    <div>
      "There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are 
      afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed." --Ray Goforth

    <div class="box3"><h1>Successful People</h1>
     <div>
      "People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they 
      find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can 
      even become a self-fulfilling prophecy." --Tony Robbins

  <div class="inside">"Sometimes beautiful things come into our lives out of nowhere. 
    We can't always understand them, but we have to trust in them. I know you want to question 
    everything, but sometimes it pays to just have a little faith." - Lauren Kate
